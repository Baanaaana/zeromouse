A custom [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration for the **ZeroMOUSE** smart pet door. Monitor your cat flap status, detection events, and view captured images — all from your Home Assistant dashboard.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Baanaaana&repository=ZeroMOUSE-HomeAssistant&category=integration)

Or manually:

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to **Integrations** → click the **three-dot menu** → **Custom repositories**
3. Add this repository URL with category **Integration**
4. Search for **ZeroMOUSE** and install
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/zeromouse` folder to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Features

- **Email/password login** — use your existing ZeroMOUSE account, no tokens or technical setup required
- **Auto-discovery** — your devices are found automatically after login
- **Live status** — flap lock state, prey blocking, event counts, WiFi signal, device connectivity
- **Detection events** — last event type, classification (prey/clean/test), timestamp
- **Event images** — latest detection photo displayed as a native HA image entity
- **HACS compatible** — easy install and updates

> **Required custom cards (install via HACS → Frontend):**
> - [mushroom-cards](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom) for the title card
> - [swipe-card](https://github.com/bramkragten/swipe-card) for the image carousel
>
> **Fallback (no custom cards):** Replace `custom:mushroom-title-card` with a `markdown` card and `custom:swipe-card` with a single `picture-entity` pointing at `image.zeromouse_last_event`:
> ```yaml
> - type: markdown
>   content: |
>     ## ZeroMOUSE
>     {{ states('sensor.zeromouse_last_event_classification') | title }}
>     — {{ relative_time(states.sensor.zeromouse_last_event_time.state | as_datetime) }} ago
> - type: picture-entity
>   entity: image.zeromouse_last_event
>   show_state: false
>   show_name: false
>   aspect_ratio: 4x3
> ```
>
> Events have between 5-8 images. The carousel will show "unavailable" for missing slots — that's expected and won't break the layout.

## Mobile Notification with Image

Send a notification to your phone with the detection image when a new event occurs. Add this automation:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: ZeroMOUSE detection alert
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.zeromouse_last_event_time
    action:
      - variables:
          cat_name: "Cat"  # Change to your cat's name
          snapshot_filename: zeromouse_{{ now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S') }}.jpg
      - action: image.snapshot
        target:
          entity_id: image.zeromouse_last_event
        data:
          filename: /config/www/zeromouse/{{ snapshot_filename }}
      - delay:
          milliseconds: 500
      - variables:
          classification: "{{ states('sensor.zeromouse_last_event_classification') }}"
      - action: notify.mobile_app_<your_phone>
        data:
          title: >
            {% if classification == 'prey' %}⚠️ Prey detected!
            {% elif classification == 'undecidable' %}⚠️ Uncertain detection
            {% else %}ZeroMOUSE{% endif %}
          message: >
            {% set messages = {
              'prey': cat_name ~ ' tried to bring in prey — entry was blocked!',
              'clean': cat_name ~ ' entered without prey.',
              'undecidable': 'Uncertain detection for ' ~ cat_name ~ ' — check the image.',
              'out': cat_name ~ ' went outside.',
              'late': 'Classification arrived too late — ' ~ cat_name ~ ' already through.',
              'test': 'Test event triggered.',
            } %}
            {{ messages.get(classification, classification ~ ' event detected') }}
          data:
            image: /local/zeromouse/{{ snapshot_filename }}
            push:
              interruption-level: "{{ 'critical' if classification in ['prey', 'undecidable'] else 'active' }}"
```

Replace `mobile_app_<your_phone>` with your device's notify service name.

## How it works

This integration communicates with the ZeroMOUSE cloud API (the same backend the official mobile app uses). It polls the device shadow state every 10 seconds and checks for new detection events every 60 seconds. No local network access to the device is required.

## Troubleshooting

**"Incorrect email or password"**
Make sure you're using the same credentials as the ZeroMOUSE mobile app.

**"No devices found"**
Your device must have recorded at least one detection event for auto-discovery to work. Open the ZeroMOUSE app and trigger a test event first.

**"Cannot connect to ZeroMOUSE cloud"**
Your Home Assistant instance needs internet access to reach AWS (eu-central-1 region).

**Session expired / re-authentication**
If your session expires (typically after several months), Home Assistant will show a notification. Click it to re-enter your credentials.
