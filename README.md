The ZeroMOUSE name and logo are trademarks of their respective owners and are used here solely for identification purposes. This project has no affiliation with ZeroMOUSE.

A custom [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration for the **ZeroMOUSE** smart pet door. Monitor your cat flap status, detection events, and view captured images — all from your Home Assistant dashboard.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Baanaaana&repository=ZeroMOUSE-HomeAssistant&category=integration)

Or manually:

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to **Integrations** → click the **three-dot menu** → **Custom repositories**
3. Add this repository URL with category **Integration**
4. Search for **ZeroMOUSE** and install
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/zeromouse` folder to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Features

- **Email/password login** — use your existing ZeroMOUSE account, no tokens or technical setup required
- **Auto-discovery** — your devices are found automatically after login
- **Live status** — flap lock state, prey blocking, event counts, WiFi signal, device connectivity
- **Detection events** — last event type, classification (prey/clean/test), timestamp
- **Event images** — latest detection photo displayed as a native HA image entity
- **HACS compatible** — easy install and updates

## Entities

| Entity | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Flap blocked | Binary sensor | Whether the flap is currently locked |
| Prey blocking enabled | Binary sensor | Whether prey blocking is active |
| Device connected | Binary sensor | Whether the device is online |
| Event count | Sensor | Total detection events |
| PIR triggers | Sensor | Total PIR motion triggers |
| Block count | Sensor | Times the flap was blocked |
| Unblock count | Sensor | Times the flap was unblocked |
| Last event type | Sensor | e.g. CAT_ENTERED |
| Last event classification | Sensor | e.g. clean, prey, test, out |
| Last event time | Sensor | Timestamp of the last detection |
| Undecidable mode | Sensor | How uncertain detections are handled |
| WiFi signal | Sensor | Device WiFi RSSI (dBm) |
| Boot count | Sensor | Device restart count |
| Firmware version | Sensor | Current firmware version |
| Last reset reason | Sensor | Why the device last rebooted (SW, WDT, etc.) |
| MQTT errors | Sensor | MQTT error count |
| Camera status | Sensor | Camera health (OK or Error) |
| IR sensor status | Sensor | IR sensor health (OK or Error) |
| Last event | Image | Photo from the latest detection event |

## Setup

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration**
2. Search for **ZeroMOUSE**
3. Enter your ZeroMOUSE account **email** and **password** (same as the mobile app)
4. Your device is discovered automatically — done!

## Dashboard Card

Add this YAML to your dashboard for a ZeroMOUSE overview card:

```yaml
type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - type: picture-entity
    entity: image.zeromouse_last_event
    show_state: false
    show_name: false
  - type: entities
    entities:
      - entity: sensor.zeromouse_last_event_classification
        name: Classification
      - entity: sensor.zeromouse_last_event_type
        name: Event Type
      - entity: sensor.zeromouse_last_event_time
        name: Event Time
      - entity: binary_sensor.zeromouse_flap_blocked
        name: Flap Blocked
      - entity: binary_sensor.zeromouse_prey_blocking_enabled
        name: Prey Blocking
```

## Mobile Notification with Image

Send a notification to your phone with the detection image when a new event occurs. Add this automation:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: ZeroMOUSE detection alert
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.zeromouse_last_event_type
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ trigger.to_state.state not in ['unknown', 'unavailable'] }}"
    action:
      - variables:
          snapshot_filename: zeromouse_{{ now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S') }}.jpg
      - action: image.snapshot
        target:
          entity_id: image.zeromouse_last_event
        data:
          filename: /config/www/zeromouse/{{ snapshot_filename }}
      - delay:
          milliseconds: 500
      - action: notify.mobile_app_<your_phone>
        data:
          title: "ZeroMOUSE"
          message: "{{ states('sensor.zeromouse_last_event_classification') | title }} event detected"
          data:
            image: /local/zeromouse/{{ snapshot_filename }}
            push:
              interruption-level: critical
```

Replace `mobile_app_<your_phone>` with your device's notify service name.

## How it works

This integration communicates with the ZeroMOUSE cloud API (the same backend the official mobile app uses). It polls the device shadow state every 10 seconds and checks for new detection events every 60 seconds. No local network access to the device is required.

## Troubleshooting

**"Incorrect email or password"**
Make sure you're using the same credentials as the ZeroMOUSE mobile app.

**"No devices found"**
Your device must have recorded at least one detection event for auto-discovery to work. Open the ZeroMOUSE app and trigger a test event first.

**"Cannot connect to ZeroMOUSE cloud"**
Your Home Assistant instance needs internet access to reach AWS (eu-central-1 region).

**Session expired / re-authentication**
If your session expires (typically after several months), Home Assistant will show a notification. Click it to re-enter your credentials.
