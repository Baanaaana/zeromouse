A custom [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration for the **ZeroMOUSE** smart pet door. Monitor your cat flap status, detection events, and view captured images — all from your Home Assistant dashboard.

## Features

- **Email/password login** — use your existing ZeroMOUSE account, no tokens or technical setup required
- **Auto-discovery** — your devices are found automatically after login
- **Live status** — flap lock state, prey blocking, event counts, WiFi signal
- **Detection events** — last event type, classification (prey/clean/test), timestamp
- **Event images** — latest detection photo displayed as a native HA image entity
- **HACS compatible** — easy install and updates

## Entities

| Entity | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Flap blocked | Binary sensor | Whether the flap is currently locked |
| Prey blocking enabled | Binary sensor | Whether prey blocking is active |
| Event count | Sensor | Total detection events |
| PIR triggers | Sensor | Total PIR motion triggers |
| Block count | Sensor | Times the flap was blocked |
| Unblock count | Sensor | Times the flap was unblocked |
| Last event type | Sensor | e.g. CAT_ENTERED |
| Last event classification | Sensor | e.g. clean, prey, test, out |
| Last event time | Sensor | Timestamp of the last detection |
| Undecidable mode | Sensor | How uncertain detections are handled |
| WiFi signal | Sensor | Device WiFi RSSI (dBm) |
| Boot count | Sensor | Device restart count |
| Firmware version | Sensor | Current firmware version |
| Last event | Image | Photo from the latest detection event |

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Baanaaana&repository=ZeroMOUSE-HomeAssistant&category=integration)

Or manually:

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to **Integrations** → click the **three-dot menu** → **Custom repositories**
3. Add this repository URL with category **Integration**
4. Search for **ZeroMOUSE** and install
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/zeromouse` folder to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Setup

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration**
2. Search for **ZeroMOUSE**
3. Enter your ZeroMOUSE account **email** and **password** (same as the mobile app)
4. Your device is discovered automatically — done!

## How it works

This integration communicates with the ZeroMOUSE cloud API (the same backend the official mobile app uses). It polls the device shadow state every 10 seconds and checks for new detection events every 60 seconds. No local network access to the device is required.

## Troubleshooting

**"Incorrect email or password"**
Make sure you're using the same credentials as the ZeroMOUSE mobile app.

**"No devices found"**
Your device must have recorded at least one detection event for auto-discovery to work. Open the ZeroMOUSE app and trigger a test event first.

**"Cannot connect to ZeroMOUSE cloud"**
Your Home Assistant instance needs internet access to reach AWS (eu-central-1 region).

**Session expired / re-authentication**
If your session expires (typically after several months), Home Assistant will show a notification. Click it to re-enter your credentials.
